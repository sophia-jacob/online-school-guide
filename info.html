        There are 3 types of tutorials for online teaching. They are the Screen Recording tutorial,
        the Virtual Meeting tutorial, and the Asynchronous Lesson tutorial! In each page of those, they have tutorials that guide you through on how
        to do those!         It is helpful, especially for teachers because of online school, they now have to go on to a new routine, that they are not used to!
        And to make it easier, I put together a website that guides you through on how to get prepared for the school year!
